              <p>Quang' personality test</p>
              <img src="images/Q.jpg">
              <p>As we can see on the personality test, Quang is an agreeableness person and I can feel that too since we rarely have any conflict when we group working. He is the most hardworking person in the group and always push the team to reach the deadlines. </p>
              <p>Kien' personality test</p>
              <img src="images/Ki.jpg">
              <p>Kiên is the one who care every small detail in the group. Whenever there is something wrong in the group, he always figure it out and fix it. He does not talk much but he is the type of person that listen to the other. This maybe his introvert personality. Although he has introvert personality, when we work in work and know more about him, he is an insane guy.</p>
              <p>Khang' personality test</p>
              <img src="images/Kh.jpg">
              <p>Khang is more like an openness person as I see. However, he still has a bit of neuroticism but that is not bad since he has a bit of OCD since he always think what we have done is not good enough and we always can improve it. Moreover, he is a fast learner and he has the will to help any member in the group when we are needed.</p>
              <p>2.	Project ideas</p>
              <p>This will be the project that support the users in the area of health. There are many people have high/low blood pressure, and many stroke death caused by this issue. This project will created an app that link the smartphone with a smart watch or any kind of sphygmomanometer and it will alert when the blood pressure meet the emergency state. Besides, it will help the user create a lifestyle that can help them in their blood pressure issue. There are many people is the victim of high/low blood pressure. In Vietnam, there are ¼ of adult has high/low blood pressure. However, to recognize how high or low their blood pressure is, they have to use the sphygmomanometer to see it. It is not that they can check it all the time and when the blood pressure is actually high or low to the alert point, they cannot know. This is the main reason lead to the stroke. Also, it is the motivation for the project to create an app that link the phone with a sphygmomanometer so when the user’ blood pressure reach the alert point, it will have an alarm to let the user know before it too late. This will be an app that launch in mobile device like smartphone, tablet, and smart watch. The app will have the common sphygmomanometer program. It will show the blood pressure rate of the user. This function help it act like a mobile sphygmomanometer which there are apps that have the same function already. Moreover, the app will have another function that collect the data of the user and create a suitable life schedule and meal for the users since the some type of food and activities might bring terribly bad affect to their health. Also it let the user keep on track of their blood pressure to show how improve they have been doing. First, to use the app, the user need to have a brief blood pressure test so the app can know the user blood pressure. Then, the user need to add their personal information like age, daily activities and their current health state, etc. Then, they will have the choice to sign up or not. This account will let the user save their information so when they want to change the device, all the information and the process will be easily transfer. The next step will be the user add the phone number of their family, relatives or people who close to them. With this feature, when the user’s blood pressure at the alert state, the app will alarm and if the user does not turn off the alarm, it will alert the other in case the user was faint or unable to call for help. This feature will help reduce the unfortunate risk from people that live on their own or any kind of scenario that they faint when no one surrounded. There are many programming language that can help to finish the app like JavaScript, C++, Python, Go, etc. and whichever language can help me do the project. However, I would like to use C++ or Python since I have studied a bit C++ when I was in high school and intro to IT course also provide some Python knowledge. In this course I have also learned HTML programming language but this language is not suitable for making app instead it focuses more in making website so maybe I could use HTML language to make a homepage website for the app. To create the app, the first skill needed would be IT skills which are the skills to program the app and let the app function smoothly. Besides the IT skill, it also need the medical knowledge since this is a medical app. Before make the app, we need to work with people who have the profession in the medical area. We need to validate the information from the doctor to get the accurate material to make the app and align the type of possible patient so that there will be no mistake when dialog the app user’ health state. When the project success, it would attract the interest of high and low blood pressure people. With the uses of the apps, it will minimize the damage from the disease and help the users have a better life in a convenient way. There are many people do not know how to actually deal with their blood pressure. The app can provide the knowledge to fill the knowledge the user lack of so that the users can get a healthier life. Therefore, the main purpose of it is ensure the health of the people used it to avoid the pitiful situation.
