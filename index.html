                           1.	Team profile
                           Quang’ personality test
                            
                           As we can see on the personality test, Quang is an agreeableness person and I can feel that too since we rarely have any conflict when we group working. He is the most hardworking person in the group and always push the team to reach the deadlines. 
                           Kiên’ personality test 
                           Kiên is the one who care every small detail in the group. Whenever there is something wrong in the group, he always figure it out and fix it. He does not talk much but he is the type of person that listen to the other. This maybe his introvert personality. Although he has introvert personality, when we work in work and know more about him, he is an insane guy.
                           Khang’ personality test 
                           Khang is more like an openness person as I see. However, he still has a bit of neuroticism but that is not bad since he has a bit of OCD since he always think what we have done is not good enough and we always can improve it. Moreover, he is a fast learner and he has the will to help any member in the group when we are needed.
                           2.	Tools
                           
                           3.	Project ideas
                           Overview:
                           This will be the project that support the users in the area of health. There are many people have high/low blood pressure, and many stroke death caused by this issue. This project will created an app that link the smartphone with a smart watch or any kind of sphygmomanometer and it will alert when the blood pressure meet the emergency state. Besides, it will help the user create a lifestyle that can help them in their blood pressure issue.
                           Motivation:
                           There are many people is the victim of high/low blood pressure. In Vietnam, there are ¼ of adult has high/low blood pressure. However, to recognize how high or low their blood pressure is, they have to use the sphygmomanometer to see it. It is not that they can check it all the time and when the blood pressure is actually high or low to the alert point, they cannot know. This is the main reason lead to the stroke. Also, it is the motivation for the project to create an app that link the phone with a sphygmomanometer so when the user’ blood pressure reach the alert point, it will have an alarm to let the user know before it too late.
                           Description:
                           This will be an app that launch in mobile device like smartphone, tablet, and smart watch. The app will have the common sphygmomanometer program. It will show the blood pressure rate of the user. This function help it act like a mobile sphygmomanometer which there are apps that have the same function already. Moreover, the app will have another function that collect the data of the user and create a suitable life schedule and meal for the users since the some type of food and activities might bring terribly bad affect to their health. Also it let the user keep on track of their blood pressure to show how improve they have been doing. First, to use the app, the user need to have a brief blood pressure test so the app can know the user blood pressure. Then, the user need to add their personal information like age, daily activities and their current health state, etc. Then, they will have the choice to sign up or not. This account will let the user save their information so when they want to change the device, all the information and the process will be easily transfer. The next step will be the user add the phone number of their family, relatives or people who close to them. With this feature, when the user’s blood pressure at the alert state, the app will alarm and if the user does not turn off the alarm, it will alert the other in case the user was faint or unable to call for help. This feature will help reduce the unfortunate risk from people that live on their own or any kind of scenario that they faint when no one surrounded. 
                           Tools and technologies:
                           There are many programming language that can help to finish the app like JavaScript, C++, Python, Go, etc. and whichever language can help me do the project. However, I would like to use C++ or Python since I have studied a bit C++ when I was in high school and intro to IT course also provide some Python knowledge. In this course I have also learned HTML programming language but this language is not suitable for making app instead it focuses more in making website so maybe I could use HTML language to make a homepage website for the app.
                           Skill required:
                           To create the app, the first skill needed would be IT skills which are the skills to program the app and let the app function smoothly. Besides the IT skill, it also need the medical knowledge since this is a medical app. Before make the app, we need to work with people who have the profession in the medical area. We need to validate the information from the doctor to get the accurate material to make the app and align the type of possible patient so that there will be no mistake when dialog the app user’ health state.
                           Outcome:
                           When the project success, it would attract the interest of high and low blood pressure people. With the uses of the apps, it will minimize the damage from the disease and help the users have a better life in a convenient way. There are many people do not know how to actually deal with their blood pressure. The app can provide the knowledge to fill the knowledge the user lack of so that the users can get a healthier life. Therefore, the main purpose of it is ensure the health of the people used it to avoid the pitiful situation.
                           4.	Feedback
                           Your project is reliable and it will get the attention from many people. I have known many people have the same 
                           5.	IT technologies
                           In the development of technologies, there are 2 things I would like to discuss about which are cloud computing and blockchain, cryptocurrencies. I would like to talk about these 2 because of their fast and convenient.
                           Cloud computing
                           What does it do?
                           Cloud computing in general is the use of internet to so that people can save and access them from anywhere. Since the cloud computing was invented, the information flow is much faster. Back then, when you finish your work, you have to save it to your hardware and move it by some type of storing device like USB or HDD hard drive. At the same time, when you want to access the other’s work by come to their save files in their hardware and it is relatively time consuming and inconvenient. However, with the development of technology, many things can be saved and accessed online. Most of everything we use and have on the internet every day is partly the result of cloud computing for example Facebook, Canvas, articles, etc. Cloud computing was invented for quite a time and its market attract the lots of client and that change dramatically recently. For example, in 2018, 62% of CRM software was cloud-based so maybe in about next 3 years, the amount could rise even more. There are a few disadvantage of cloud computing which are the security of it. Since everyone can somehow access, hence the sometimes security is an issue because it could be cyber attacked. However, that is the area of cybersecurity and privacy. Since IT is a combination of many technologies in a large field, sometimes a field of discussion cannot explain all.
                           What is the likely impact?
                           Cloud computing contribute a lot in world development, especially for the 4.0 industrial revolution when the information flow can do much faster. Moreover, in this modern world, it occur everywhere in the humanity daily life. Whenever we listen to a song, that is someone work that is posted on the internet and we access it. Whenever students do research for the assignment, they actually use cloud computing. One of the thing that could possibly happen in the future is the USB and hard disk might not be manufactured anymore. With the common use of cloud computing in the close future, everyone can save things on cloud instead of their hard disks. Perhaps, in the near future, laptop and mobile phone will not have the memory disk but everyone will have their own cloud account to use on the internet.
                           How will this affect you?
                           As I mentioned above, it occur in everyone’ modern life. All the things I get accessed on the internet is a part of cloud computing. There are 2 things that I feel like that I am really appreciate this technology. First it is all the academic sources that I retrieved on the internet. Back then, this is not something I was into because high school does not require that much knowledge from the internet besides textbook to survive. However, when I am attend to university, with all the research needed to be done, the information can get through the internet to do report is significantly vital for my university life. Second, the amount of entertainment I have from the internet is one of thing I have been used from my childhood until now. Besides me, probably every member in my family or my friends have the same benefit from the development of cloud computing from what it provide. Moreover, on the other side we get other benefit that we can save our file on it. One of the common cloud that can be well known is the google drive and it help us save a lot of things up there.
                           Block chain and cryptocurrencies
                           What does it do?
                           Blockchain is the thing store a set of data piece which are blocks and in each block have multiple transaction and it will be all change when there is a transaction happen whereas cryptocurrencies is the digital currencies that can be trade on the internet. Its value is determined by the user. The blockchain can be called as the tool to help us find the cryptocurrencies. There are many misunderstand about cryptocurrencies in some areas and Vietnam is one of these areas. People usually say that cryptocurrencies is a scam. However, it is a fact the cryptocurrencies is relatively valuable. Take Bitcoin, the most common and valuable cryptocurrencies in the current market. Bitcoin has the price of slightly more than 500 million vnd per coin and overall it is increasing day by day. Bitcoin has this value because several reasons. First, it is rare, there are only total of 21 million Bitcoin in the world. Yet back then, about 10 years ago, the value of Bitcoin is nothing because people do not consider its value. However, it becomes more expensive now because it started to have its value on the consumer and the rate of inflation. There are only 21 million Bitcoin so it literately cannot generate more no matter what so its value will increase consistently. Second, it has the fastest way to transfer money from a place to the other. For example, if you want to transfer the money to someone in a common way, it would be easy if you sit next to a person and give it to them. However, if you want to make a transaction from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, it will take days and if you want to make a transaction from Vietnam to the U.S. it takes weeks. On the other hand, with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, you only need a few second to transact to anywhere worldwide. In addition, blockchain is help the cryptocurrencies system become invincible, in this case I mean cannot be hacked. In theory, it can be if the hacker have the amount of device equal to the amount of the Bitcoin device and hack in the same time which is not possible. That is why the Bitcoin can be totally trusted. Overall, cryptocurrencies is the digital money whereas blockchain is a system that record all the transaction in all the device the running cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency has been changed constantly since it was invented, not the way but the value of it. Its value in short-term might increase or decrease but in long-term it always increase. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the cryptocurrency will increase in the next 3 years and it might become the future money in the future. Moreover, the system of cryptocurrencies is relatively save with blockchain in the current period so I have no idea if it will have any improvement in the future.
                           What is likely impact?
                           Nowadays, cryptocurrencies is not yet a common currency on the world. However, it has a huge potential but it is not that everyone can realize the potential of it. In the future, we might use cryptocurrencies instead of the currencies that we are using right now. With all the benefit that we can get from the cryptocurrencies that I mentioned above, cryptocurrencies is capability to be the future currencies. In consequence to this scenario, the numerous of bank would cease because there no longer needed to store the money. In addition, the current paper money might be disappear. All the transaction would become the transactions of cryptocurrencies. There are many case that banks got hack and lost a significant amount of money. This is because usually the transaction record in the main server of the bank so it can be hacked. It is not only the loss of money for the people but also the loss of reputation of the bank. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies with blockchain is mostly likely save and when people realize the potential of it, the time for cryptocurrencies will come.
                           How will this affect you?
                           As a consumer, I am also affect by the world currencies. At the current state, cryptocurrencies and blockchain do not have any direct impact to me. Still, in the near future which I am quite sure that cryptocurrencies will become a common currency, me and not only me but also the other will be affected by this change. In the future, my mom can go to the supermarket and buy stuff by the cryptocurrencies. I and my friends buy bubbles tea by the cryptocurrencies instead of VND. Soon the currencies will slowly change. However, that will be a long way to go since the digital money is quite overvalue at the moment. For example, 1 Bitcoin equal more the 500 million VND, so we cannot use it to buy things in grocery store yet. 
                           6.	IT work
                           I have interviewed the IT man in the place where my dad work and this is the result.
                           What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
                           As he told me that he has many task in a day and most of them is surround computer especially coding. Most of his time, he sit in the office and work on a coding project with his IT friends. Whenever there is anyone in the company need him to check the device, he will come and help. Otherwise, his main job is coding and sell the code for the other for several purpose. Some of his group’ code is used in education while some others are used in the part of some mini game code. 
                           What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
                           He interact with many other people. As he work in the company that is not an IT company, he has to check the IT and cyber security for the company every day since there are only him and 1 other IT guy in charge of IT area for the company. Moreover, he has to assist his colleague when their devices cause any problem. Besides the people in the company, he has online meeting with the other IT professionals to discuss about the ongoing code that they are working on. His clients is the one who buy his code and most of the time they meet online. The revenue of the code will share equal among the coding group. He said that he want to find an investor to financial support the group to make their own project but he has not found one yet.
                           Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?
                           Most of the time, he spend his time with coding. However, he work as a standard office hour. He goes to the company and work from 8 am to 5 pm every day. When he goes home, he still have a regular daily life. He spend his free time to play some games or continue his coding project. But most of the time, he spend his time with his electronic devices like PC, laptop.
                           What aspect of their position is most challenging?
